= libisofs =

libisofs is a library to create an ISO-9660 filesystem, and supports extensions like RockRidge and Joliet. It is also a full featured ISO-9660 editor, allowing you to modify an ISO image or multisession disc, including file addition/removal, change of file names and attributes, and similar.

The old libisofs.so.5 has been declarated deprecated and frozen, leaving it unmaintained. A full refactoring of the design has been done during the last months, and the next generation libisofs.so.6 of the library will be released in the following days.

== Source Code ==

The code is maintained in a [http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Bazaar] repository at Launchpad (https://launchpad.net/libisofs/). You can download it with:
