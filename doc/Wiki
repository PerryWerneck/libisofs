= libisofs =

libisofs is a library to create an ISO-9660 filesystem, and supports extensions like !RockRidge or Joliet. It is also a full featured ISO-9660 editor, allowing you to modify an ISO image or multisession disc, including file addition/removal, change of file names and attributes, etc

The old libisofs has been declarated deprecated and frozen, it won't be maintained anymore. A full refactoring of the design has been done during this last months, and a next generation of the library will be released in the next days.

== Source Code ==

The code is maintained in a [http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Bazaar] repository at Launchpad (https://launchpad.net/libisofs/). You can download it with:
